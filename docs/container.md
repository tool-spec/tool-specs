# Container structure

## tl;dr;
In order to be recognized as a tool following this specification, a container 
image has to meet these requirements:

1. A description of the tool, its arguments, parameters and input data has to be present in YAML format at the container location `/src/tool.yml`
2. The executable script/program has to either store results at the location `/out/` of the container, or print them to the containers StdOut.
3. A tool execution may be parameterized. The parameterization is stored at `/in/input.json` of the container. Additional input data may be added to `/in/input.json`.

## Description

In order to work properly, there is a minimum required structure, that the 
container has to follow. In  order to build a container image accordingly,
there are a number of template repositories on Github:

* [Python template](https://github.com/tool-spec/tool_template_python)
* [R template](https://github.com/tool-spec/tool_template_r)
* [Node.js template](https://github.com/tool-spec/tool_template_node)
* [Octave template](https://github.com/tool-spec/tool_template_octave)
* [MATLAB template](https://github.com/tool-spec/tool_template_matlab)
* [Jupyter template](https://github.com/tool-spec/tool_template_jupyter)
* [TypeScript template](https://github.com/tool-spec/tool_template_typescript)

The core idea is to enforce a specific structure in the container, so that 
others know where to find things:

```
/
|- in/
|  |- input.json
|- out/
|  |- ...
|- src/
|  |- tool.yml
|  |- run.[py/R/js/m]
|  |- CITATION.cff
```

Here, the two locations `/in` and `/out` are mount points to pass data and 
parameters in and out of the container.

### Input parameterization

`/in/input.json` contains the the parameterization for running the tool. 
There are client libraries for each of the supported languages, which read and 
validate the parameterization. Runtime CLI parameters are not yet supported but are planned for future implementation.

### Metadata

`/src/tool.yml` is a mandatory metadata file containing the most important 
information about the tool.

### Entrypoint

`/src/run.[py/R/js/m]` is the single entrypoint into the tool. 
Any executable file is supported. Please note that the tool-specs support only transformation-like tools that terminate *end* upon completion; 
service tools are not supported.

Templates use [gotap](https://github.com/tool-spec/gotap) as the default Docker command. gotap validates the input and executes the tool:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["gotap", "run", "<toolname>", "--input-file", "/in/input.json"]
```

You can also run the script directly (use the Docker command, **not** entrypoint):

```Dockerfile
CMD ["python", "run.py"]
```

This way, you can `exec` or `run` into the container and `cat /src/tool.yml`
to build frameworks that can read the metadata of each tool available on the system.

### Citation information

Each of the template repositories includes a `CITATION.cff` file, which provides standardized citation metadata for your tool. As a developer, you should **replace** the placeholder citation information in the template with details relevant to your own project.

The `CITATION.cff` file helps users properly cite your tool/software, increasing its visibility and ensuring you receive appropriate credit. It also aligns your project with FAIR principles by making citation metadata machine-readable and interoperable.

GitHub automatically detects this file and displays a “Cite this repository” button. When used with services like Zenodo, the metadata from `CITATION.cff` can be used to generate a DOI with embedded citation information. Other tools such as Zotero also support this format.

The `CITATION.cff` file full format specifications and documentation is described [here](https://citation-file-format.github.io/).
